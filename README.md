# Supervised-Machine-Learning
Please find in this directory the mathematical explanation of predictors (e.g. Univariate Linear Regression, Multivariate Linear Regression) and classifiers (e.g. Logistics Regression, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine) used in Supervised Machine Learning, as well as certain tools (e.g. Regularization/Overfitting, Bias/Variance, Metric Evaluation) to optimize these learning models.
