# Supervised-Machine-Learning
Please find in this free opensource directory the mathematical explanations of predictors (e.g. Univariate Linear Regression, Multivariate Linear Regression) and classifiers (e.g. Logistics Regression, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine) commonly used in Supervised Machine Learning, as well as certain tools (e.g. Regularization/Overfitting, Bias/Variance, Metric Evaluation) to optimize these learning models.

This fold syntheses knowledge acquired from diverse online sources, books and academic articles. Please refer to the document Reference in Machine Learning.

Best wishes,
